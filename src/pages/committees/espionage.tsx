                  The NATO Espionage and Intelligence Committee represents the
                  intelligence agencies of all NATO members and partners, aiming
                  to gather information to aid North Atlantic Council (NAC)
                  members. A blend between IPC, Ad Hoc, and something special,
                  delegates are not confined to a committee room. You will
                  instead traverse through other committees solving intelligence
                  clues provided by the dais team. Espionage demands
                  resourcefulness and quick thinking as delegates tip-toe around
                  the halls, investigate real people, and send directives to
                  gather vital information however you see fit. Success depends
                  on your ability to outwit your enemies and strategize
                  creatively. With high stakes and unparalleled independence,
                  the Espionage Committee embraces chaos and creativity.
